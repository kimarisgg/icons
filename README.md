## What is @kimaris/icons?

`@kimaris/icons` is a collection of simply open source icons. Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid. This project is based on [feathericons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) yet it was made to fulfill a purpose on our projects that feather alone wasn't able to.

```shell
npm i @kimaris/icons
```
